# DynamicLOD

Based on muumimorko Idea and Code in MSFS_AdaptiveLOD.<br/><br/>

Please do not use it. It hacks your Memory. Maybe you get banned. It is bad!
<br/><br/>

## Requirements

- .NET 7 Runtime
- MF Event/WASM Module

<br/>

## Installation

- Extract to a reasonable Folder
- AV Exclusions may be required
- Run as Admin is NOT required

<br/>

## Usage

- The first Pair with AGL 0 can not be deleted. The AGL can not be changed. Only the xLOD.
- Additional Pairs can be added at any AGL and xLOD desired.
- Plus is Add, Minus is Remove, S is Set (Change). Remove and Set require to select the Pair first.
- Switching is on your VS Trend - it will not change to a lower Pair (descreasing AGL) while your Climbing and vice versa.
- Rest should be self-explanatory.

<br/>

## Options

Use the GUI for Configuration.
