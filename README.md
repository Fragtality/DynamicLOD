# DynamicLOD

Based on muumimorko's Idea and Code in MSFS_AdaptiveLOD.<br/>
It just a small Test / Proof-of-Concept if MSFS Performance could be improved when dynamically changing the TLOD (and OLOD) based on the current AGL.<br/><br/>
That being said, DynamicLOD is not meant to be a "User facing" Tool - I can't recommend using it. It actively modifies the Memory of MSFS (basically it works like any "Cheat Trainer"). It likely **violates the Usage Terms** and can be treated as **potential ban-worthy** Behavior. It is like Cheating in a FPS.<br/>So I'm not in anyway responsible for (or interested in) any Problems you're facing using something you should not use.<br/><br/>

You have been warned.

## Requirements

- .NET 7 Runtime
- MF Event/WASM Module

<br/>

## Installation

- Extract to a reasonable Folder
- AV Exclusions may be required
- Run as Admin is NOT required

<br/>

## Usage

- The first Pair with AGL 0 can not be deleted. The AGL can not be changed. Only the xLOD.
- Additional Pairs can be added at any AGL and xLOD desired.
- Plus is Add, Minus is Remove, S is Set (Change). Remove and Set require to select the Pair first.
- Switching is on your VS Trend - it will not change to a lower Pair (descreasing AGL) while your Climbing and vice versa.
- Rest should be self-explanatory.
